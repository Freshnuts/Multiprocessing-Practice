# mp_loop

Essentially, this program creates a loop on multiprocessing threads.<br>
<br>
In the menu you have the option to create a thread using t1,<br>
't1shell' initializes the t1 process thread. 't1join' can be run<br>
AFTER 't1shell' starts 't1' running the loop. 't1lock' is used in <br>
replacement of 't1shell' to LOCK the running process until it's finished.<br>
