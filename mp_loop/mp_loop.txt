mp_loop

Creates a # loop on multiple processes threads. We can run the 2
processes synchronously, or lock thread 1 down.

1. t1 - Calls multiprocessing.Process().
2. t1loop - Initializes multiprocessing.Process(). Aka - Calls looper()
   on a seperate thread. NO LOCK.

p01.start()

*Calls looper() in a different process in the background, then we
 return to the main process, meaning we can still access the menu.

3. t1join - Lock thread AFTER t1 is initiated by t1loop.

p01.join()  # Lock the process thread, until it is finished.

*User can execute this at anytime the p01 is initiated.

4. t1lock - Lock thread from the beginning.

p01.start() # Start the process thread.
p01.join()  # Lock the process thread, until it is finished.

5. t2 - Creates process thread #2.

6. t2loop - Starts the thread, and runs the loop function.
